\## Step 1: Generate Simulated Data\

```{r}
# Set the seed for reproducibility
set.seed(1)
# Create x as a sequence of numbers from 1 to 100
x <- seq(1, 100, by = 1)
# Generate y as a noisy sine wave: y = sin(x * 10) + e, where e ~ N(0, 0.2^2)
e <- rnorm(length(x), mean = 0, sd = 0.2) # generate noise
y <- sin(x * 10) + e # noisy sine wave
```
